						Efficiency and perfection. <br>
						Every line of code, every decision, every project I undertake follows this premise. <br>
						I don't try to do enough, I try to do the best". <br><br>

						My approach has always been clear: optimise, polish, refine. <br>
						I am not a conformist. The idea of leaving something half done is as alien to me as it is unacceptable.	
						Every day is an opportunity to improve, to learn something new, to challenge my own limits. Being good at 
						something is not enough; my goal is to be the best. <br><br>

						Perfectionism has been both my driving force and my challenge. <br>
						It pushes me to achieve levels of precision and excellence, but it also forces me to know how and when to stop.	Over 
						time, I have learned that true mastery lies not only in flawless execution, but in the ability to evolve without getting caught up in an obsession with detail.

						Technology was not a choice; it was a natural path. <br>
						Since I was a child, my curiosity led me to explore the hidden codes of video games, to discover
						vulnerabilities in systems and to understand that, in this digital world, 
						everything is malleable. <br><br>
						My first formal steps in computer science began with the intermediate level. <br>
                        It was in that environment that I discovered cybersecurity and its infinite complexity. <br> <br>
                        
						What others saw as a set of rules, I understood as a constant challenge, 
						a game of strategy where every decision counts.
						I am currently on my way to a degree in Networked Computer Systems Administration,
 						with the aim of specialising in Cybersecurity.
                        It's not just a degree, it's a commitment to a career that demands adaptability, creativity and, above all,
 						a hacker mentality - in the purest sense of the term: question, understand and improve.

				<div class="chapter" id="chapter3">
					<p>
						What caught me in this field was not the idea of protecting systems, but the fact that we are never really safe....	<br><br>
						There is always a vulnerability, a backdoor, a human oversight that can be exploited.
						That makes this world so challenging and fascinating.
						I've learned that the best way to understand security is to think like an attacker. 
						Every system, every network, every application has its Achilles heel. <br> <br>
						I will always stick with this phrase... "every system is vulnerable until proven otherwise" <br><br>
						Identifying it before it is done by someone with malicious intent is what makes the difference.
						My goal is to master this field. Not only to be competent, but to become a reference.
						Not for public recognition, but for the professional respect of those who understand the true depth of this world.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="chapter4">
					<p>
						In five years, I see myself established in cybersecurity, accumulating certifications such as 
						CompTIA Pentest+, OSCP, GCFA and many more... <br><br>
						I imagine myself working in a multinational or government agency, leading teams, developing
						strategies and making a difference in the protection of data and systems. <br><br>

						I imagine myself working in a multinational or government agency, leading teams, developing
						strategies and making a difference in data protection and systems. <br><br>

						But beyond professional success, what I really want is to know that I am on the right path, 
						that every day I am moving forward, and that every challenge that I'm facing is a step-over-side  
						to my goal: to be the best at what I do. <br>
